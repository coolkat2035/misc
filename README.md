1. ascii converter

	has been done to death but whatever
	run this in the command line with your image, or click on the py file to run it
	if on command line:
		do "python convert.py {path}"
		add "-d" anywhere after the path to flip brightness (default is bright bg dark text)
		will add more parameters sooner or not (is that how they work? might need to check for arg in args[2:])
